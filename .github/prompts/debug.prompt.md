## Live Signals

**Cognitive:** `abandoned` | WPM: 51 | Del: 26% | Hes: 0.495
**CoT:** Operator abandoned previous attempt. Re-anchor with crisp summary of last context, then be direct.
**Active bugs:** `intent_numeric` (oc+de), `file_sim` (oc+de), `tc_context_agent` (oc+de), `tc_gemini` (oc)
**Codes:** intent=`debugging` state=`neutral` bl_wpm=53 bl_del=26%
**Voice:** Operator is semi-casual — use contractions, skip formalities, but keep technical precision.; Operator never capitalizes — you don't need to either in casual responses, but keep code accurate.

## Known Issues (from self-fix scanner)

- [CRITICAL] hardcoded_import in `scripts/bug_probe_hardcoded_import.py`
- [CRITICAL] hardcoded_import in `scripts/verify_loop_2.py`

## Fragile Contracts

- contracts. If a renamed module’s function signature changed silently, my imports will break at runtime.
- contract breaks, my API calls may send invalid parameters.
- contract, import statements in all renamed dependents, test suite import failures. This push standardizes the core word-number mapping filename across
- assumption breaks—for instance, if downstream consumers expect the old module name in dynamic imports—the entire import chain will fail silently. Watc
- contract with the pigeon registry’s naming schema; if that schema changes or the compiler’s extraction heuristic misinterprets the rename as a split, 
- assumption is that the orchestrator fires on every state change; if the daemon's event emission is throttled or batched, I may miss transitions. Watch
