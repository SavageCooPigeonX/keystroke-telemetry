## Live Signals

**Cognitive:** `neutral` | WPM: 16 | Del: 36%
**Deleted words:** route
**Unsaid threads:** route
**Rewrites:** "route" → "write injections"
**Hot modules:** `file_heat_map` (hes=0.89), `import_rewriter` (hes=0.73), `file_writer` (hes=0.73)
**Active bugs:** `u_pe` (oc), `u_pj` (oc), `警p_sa` (oc), `册f_reg` (oc)
**Coaching:** Anticipate debugging context; Preempt import/resolver issues; Counter hesitation with precision
**Codes:** intent=`unknown` state=`neutral` bl_wpm=51 bl_del=26%
**Voice:** Operator is semi-casual — use contractions, skip formalities, but keep technical precision.; Operator never capitalizes — you don't need to either in casual responses, but keep code accurate.

## Known Issues (from self-fix scanner)

- [CRITICAL] hardcoded_import in `pigeon_brain/令f_cl_s009_v002_d0323_缩分话_λP.py`

## Fragile Contracts

- break silently, causing the rename safety check to always pass or fail. Watch for uncontrolled renames on protected files.
- contract changes, the extension's rename UI will malfunction. Watch for the extension failing to reflect rename safety status.
- assumption about `_resolve.rename_safe` signature; `__main__`'s dependency on the wrapper's correctness; cascading import errors in `pigeon_compiler` 
- breaking the entire injection chain. I provide validated rename maps to 追跑f_ruhe; if my output contract changes from a flat dict to a list, its healin
- breaking the prompt pipeline.
- breaking audit trails. Watch for prompts that lose their actor tags in downstream logs.
