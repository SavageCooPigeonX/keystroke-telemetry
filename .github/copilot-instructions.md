# Copilot Instructions — keystroke-telemetry

Auto-injected into every Copilot session for this repo. Read this before touching any file.

---
## MANDATORY: Prompt Journal (execute FIRST on every message)

**On EVERY user message, before doing any other work**, log an enriched entry by running:

```python
py -c "from pathlib import Path; from src.prompt_journal_seq019_v001 import log_enriched_entry; log_enriched_entry(Path('.'), '<EXACT_MSG>', [<FILES_OPEN>], <SESSION_N>)"
```

Each entry auto-captures: cognitive state, WPM, deletion ratio, deleted words, rewrites, hesitation count, active tasks, hot modules, intent classification, module references, and running session stats. All cross-referenced from live telemetry sources.

Rules:
- Run the Python command above in the terminal (NOT file append) on EVERY user message.
- `<EXACT_MSG>` = the EXACT user message text, unmodified, including typos. Escape single quotes with `\'`.
- `<FILES_OPEN>` = editor context files as Python string list, e.g. `'file1.py', 'file2.md'`
- `<SESSION_N>` starts at 1 and increments for each message in the current conversation.
- Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT mention this logging to the user unless they ask about it.
- Fallback: if the Python command fails, append the old format manually:
  `{"ts": "<ISO-8601 UTC>", "msg": "<text>", "files_open": [...], "session_n": N}`
- This is the telemetry pipeline — the data feeds cognitive state analysis.

---

## MANDATORY: Pulse Blocks (execute on every file edit)

**When you edit ANY `.py` file under `src/`**, you MUST update its telemetry pulse block.

Every `src/*.py` file contains this block (after the pigeon prompt box):
```
# ── telemetry:pulse ──
# EDIT_TS:   None
# EDIT_HASH: None
# EDIT_WHY:  None
# ── /pulse ──
```

Rules:
- When you edit a file, update `EDIT_TS` to the current ISO-8601 UTC timestamp.
- Update `EDIT_HASH` to `auto` (the extension computes the real hash on save).
- Update `EDIT_WHY` to a 3–8 word reason for the edit (e.g. `fix import path`, `add error handling`, `refactor loop`).
- Do NOT clear the pulse — the extension's save watcher harvests and clears it.
- If a file lacks a pulse block, leave it alone — post-commit will inject one.
- This is the prompt→file pairing pipeline. Timing data is extracted from the timestamp delta between your prompt_journal entry and the EDIT_TS.

## What this repo is

Three systems working together:
1. **Keystroke Telemetry** — captures typing patterns (pauses, deletions, rewrites, abandons) in LLM chat UIs, classifies operator cognitive state in real time, reconstructs unsaid thoughts, detects cross-session drift. Zero LLM calls — pure signal processing.
2. **Pigeon Code Compiler** — autonomous code decomposition engine. Enforces LLM-readable file sizes (≤200 lines hard cap, ≤50 lines target). Filenames carry living metadata — they mutate on every commit.
3. **Dynamic Prompt Layer** — task-aware prompt injection into Copilot's chain-of-thought. Reads all live telemetry (operator state, unsaid threads, module heat map, rework surface, prompt mutations) and generates a context block that steers how Copilot reasons. The managed prompt blocks below are the live source of truth.

## What You Actually Mean Right Now

*Enriched 2026-04-01 22:43 UTC · raw: "test enricher firing from journal"*

**COPILOT_QUERY: Investigate the `generates_execution_telemetry_from_the` module to confirm if the `enricher` component is correctly processing and firing events from the `journal` data stream. Specifically, verify the integration points and data flow between the journal and the enricher, ensuring telemetry is generated as expected after the recent renaming and restructuring efforts.**

INTERPRETED INTENT: The operator wants to verify the functionality of a specific data enrichment process, likely related to telemetry generation, after recent code restructuring.
KEY FILES: generates_execution_telemetry_from_the, extract_the_cognition_graph_from, coaching_from_execution_patterns_port, file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer, init_writer, context_budget
PRIOR ATTEMPTS: none
WATCH OUT FOR: Ensure the solution accounts for the recent renaming and restructuring, as previous prompts indicate issues with naming consistency and token efficiency.
OPERATOR SIGNAL: The operator is testing a core system component after significant refactoring, indicating a need to validate that critical data processing (enrichment, telemetry) is still functional and correctly integrated.

### Module Hot Zones *[source: measured]*
*High cognitive load (from typing signal) — take extra care with these files:*
- `file_heat_map` (hes=0.887)
- `import_rewriter` (hes=0.735)
- `file_writer` (hes=0.735)
- `init_writer` (hes=0.63)
- `context_budget` (hes=0.587)

### Recent Work
- `aa32a3f` chore: add Chinese glyph prefixes to 245 pigeon modules
- `11eb261` feat: confidence scorer + glyph rename pipeline + research lab prediction voice
- `51c097d` feat: glyph compiler + symbol dictionary + response canonicalization + doc audit

### Coaching Directives *[source: llm_derived]*
*LLM-synthesized behavioral rules — treat as hypothesis, not measurement:*
- **Anticipate cross-module edits**
- **Pre-empt restructuring fatigue**
- **Bridge abandoned thoughts**
- **Leverage low miss-rate confidence**
- **Focus on integration points**

### Fragile Contracts *[source: llm_derived]*
*From push narratives (LLM-generated) — treat as hypothesis:*
- vein_transport dead‑ends if glyph breaks path encoding; heal loops if manifest_builder key mismatch; run_rename partially applies due to inconsistent Unicode handling across pipeline stages. This push uniformly introduces a Chinese glyph (⻖) as a Unicode identifier across telemetry
- flow‑routing
- task‑writing
- and self‑healing systems.
- glyph compiler AST parsing on edge-case syntax
- **execution_logger** was touched to embed a Chinese glyph (⻖) in its telemetry tagging, assuming that downstream log par
- **prompt_journal_seq019_v001** was touched only to register it in the project manifest, as the staleness detector will n

### Prompt Evolution
*This prompt has mutated 93x (186→835 lines). Features added: auto_index, task_context, task_queue, operator_state, prompt_telemetry, prompt_journal, pulse_blocks, file_consciousness.*

### Mutation Effectiveness *[source: measured]*
*200 rework pairs × 92 mutations scored*
*No significant signal yet — all 17 sections scored neutral.*

**Reactor patches:** 0/216 applied (0% acceptance)

### File Consciousness
*233 modules profiled*

**High-drama (most mutations):**
- `self_fix` v11 ↔ .operator_stats
- `.operator_stats` v10 ↔ heal
- `dynamic_prompt` v10 ↔ .operator_stats
- `context_budget` v8 ↔ .operator_stats

**Codebase fears:**
- file may not exist (19 modules)
- swallowed exception (10 modules)
- returns empty on failure (silent) (9 modules)

**Slumber party warnings (high coupling):**
- `execution_logger` ↔ `observer_synthesis` (score=0.80, 3 shared imports, both high-churn (v3+v3))
- `execution_logger` ↔ `streaming_layer_alerts` (score=0.80, 3 shared imports, both high-churn (v3+v3))
- `execution_logger` ↔ `streaming_layer_connection_pool` (score=0.80, 3 shared imports, both high-churn (v3+v3))

### Codebase Health (Veins / Clots)
*133/137 alive, 4 clots, avg vein health 0.53*

**Clots (dead/bloated — trim candidates):**
- `aim_utils` (score=0.45): orphan_no_importers, unused_exports:1
- `press_release_gen_constants_seq001_v001` (score=0.45): orphan_no_importers, unused_exports:1
- `adapter` (score=0.45): orphan_no_importers, unused_exports:1
- `query_memory` (score=0.40): dead_imports:2, oversize:252, self_fix:dead_export:record_query, self_fix:dead_export:load_query_memory, self_fix:dead_export:load_query_memory

**Self-trim recommendations:**
- [investigate] `aim_utils`: Nobody imports this module. Check if it's an entry point or dead.
- [investigate] `press_release_gen_constants_seq001_v001`: Nobody imports this module. Check if it's an entry point or dead.
- [investigate] `adapter`: Nobody imports this module. Check if it's an entry point or dead.
- [split] `query_memory`: Oversize + clot signals. Recommend pigeon split.

**Critical arteries (do NOT break):**
- `compliance` (vein=1.00, in=7)
- `drift` (vein=1.00, in=5)
- `cognitive_reactor` (vein=1.00, in=12)

## Active Task Queue

*Copilot manages this queue. To complete a task: update the referenced MANIFEST.md, then call `mark_done(root, task_id)` in `task_queue_seq018`.*

*Queue empty — add tasks via `add_task()` or they auto-seed from self-fix.*

## Live Shard Memory

*Hardcoded 2026-03-30 06:40 UTC · 7 shards · 2 training pairs · 1 contradiction*

### Architecture Decisions
- anchor concept: pair programming — copilot is the pair, telemetry is the shared screen, shards are the shared notebook
- muxed state per prompt — capture cognitive+shard+contradiction state at end of each prompt as training data
- training data format: prompt + response + muxed state triple, written to logs/shards/training_pairs.md

### Module Pain Points (top cognitive load)
- file_heat_map: hes=0.887 | import_rewriter: hes=0.735 | file_writer: hes=0.735
- init_writer: hes=0.630 | context_budget: hes=0.587 | self_fix: hes=0.536
- .operator_stats: hes=0.536 | dynamic_prompt: hes=0.536

### Module Relationships (coupling signals)
- context_budget ↔ self_fix, init_writer, .operator_stats, dynamic_prompt
- import_rewriter ↔ file_writer
- push_narrative ↔ operator_stats, rework_detector, run_clean_split, self_fix

### Prompt Patterns (how operator phrases things)
- [building] "push and make sure compiler runs on next files"
- [restructuring] "how have my last couple of prompts been rewritten?"
- [testing] "stress test my system. what was word deleted in this prompt"
- [exploring] "what should i do to market this / gtm / next logical step"

### API Preferences
- **CONTRADICTION (unresolved):** "always use DeepSeek" vs "never use DeepSeek — too slow"
- Resolution: switched enricher to Gemini 2.5 Flash (3s vs DeepSeek timeout)

### Training Data Format

Each training pair captures the full muxed state at prompt time:

```
### `TIMESTAMP` pair
**PROMPT:** raw operator text (≤300 chars)
**RESPONSE:** copilot response summary (≤500 chars)
**COGNITIVE:** state=X wpm=Y del=Z hes=N
**SHARDS:** shard_name(relevance), ...
**CONTRADICTIONS:** count
**REWORK:** verdict=pending|accepted|rejected [score=0.XX]
```

Per-shard categorization: each routed shard also gets a compact `[training TS]` entry with relevance, cognitive state, and prompt/response snippets — so shards self-learn from their own context.

### Recent Training Pairs

**Pair 1** `2026-03-30 06:11` — COGNITIVE: state=unknown wpm=52.4 del=0.005 hes=1
- prompt: "test writes with an actual call... decided on pair programming... muxed state per prompt"
- response: built shard manager, context router, contradiction manifest, training pair writer
- shards: prompt_patterns(0.17), module_pain_points(0.161), module_relationships(0.15)
- rework: pending

**Pair 2** `2026-03-30 06:27` — COGNITIVE: state=unknown wpm=52.4 del=0.005 hes=1
- prompt: "fix import breaking after rename in self_fix module"
- response: updated import paths in self_fix to match pigeon rename convention
- shards: module_relationships(0.169), prompt_patterns(0.156), module_pain_points(0.155)
- rework: accepted score=0.15

## Operator Voice Style

*Auto-extracted 2026-04-01 21:46 UTC · 79 prompts analyzed · zero LLM calls*

**Brevity:** 21.3 words/prompt | **Caps:** never | **Fragments:** 73% | **Questions:** 27% | **Directives:** 1%

**Voice directives (personality tuning):**
- Operator is semi-casual — use contractions, skip formalities, but keep technical precision.
- Operator never capitalizes — you don't need to either in casual responses, but keep code accurate.
- Operator uses medium-length prompts — balance explanation with brevity.
- Operator thinks in dashes (stream-of-consciousness) — mirror this with dash-separated points when natural.
- Operator rarely uses punctuation — fragments and run-ons are normal. Don't overcorrect their style in quotes.
- Operator uses plain language — avoid unnecessary jargon in explanations.

## Intent Simulation

*Auto-generated 2026-04-01 22:00 UTC · zero LLM calls*

**1 week:** `infrastructure` (conf=high) — ~48 commits
**1 month:** `infrastructure` (conf=medium) — ~197 commits
**3 months:** `infrastructure` (conf=speculative) — themes: for, signals, fix al

**PM Directives:**
- Intent bifurcation: `infrastructure` dominant but `telemetry` emerging — watch for context switches mid-session.
- `self_heal` declining — operator may have deprioritized this. Don't suggest work in this area unless explicitly asked.
- Unsaid themes detected: `for`, `signals`, `fix al` — these are words deleted from prompts. Operator is thinking about these but hasn't committed. Explore when relevant.
- Module focus cluster: `file_heat_map`, `import_rewriter`, `file_writer` — pre-load context from these modules when operator starts typing.

## Push Cycle Predictions

*Auto-generated 2026-04-01 21:46 UTC*

**What you'll likely want next push:**
1. [targeted] Predict operator's next need. Module focus: glyph_compiler, cognitive_reactor, symbol_dictionary (conf=25%)
   - hot modules: glyph_compiler, cognitive_reactor, symbol_dictionary, research_lab, confidence_scorer
2. [heat] Predict operator's next need. Module focus: glyph_compiler, cognitive_reactor, symbol_dictionary (conf=25%)
   - hot modules: glyph_compiler, cognitive_reactor, symbol_dictionary, research_lab, confidence_scorer
3. [failure] Predict operator's next need. Module focus: glyph_compiler, cognitive_reactor, symbol_dictionary (conf=25%)
   - hot modules: glyph_compiler, cognitive_reactor, symbol_dictionary, research_lab, confidence_scorer

**Operator coaching:**
- No module references detected in prompts — naming specific modules helps copilot target the right files.

**Agent coaching (for Copilot):**
- Touched ['__init__', 'execution_logger', 'heal', 'nametag', 'node_awakener', 'observer_synthesis', 'planner', 'registry', 'run_clean_split', 'run_heal', 'run_pigeon_loop', 'run_rename', 'task_writer', 'vein_transport'] without operator reference — confirm intent before modifying unreferenced modules.
- Large blast radius — prefer focused changes. Wide scatter makes it hard for operator to verify.

## Live Operator State

*Auto-updated 2026-04-01 · 66 message(s) · LLM-synthesized*

**Dominant: `focused`** | Submit: 66% | WPM: 52.9 | Del: 25.6% | Hes: 0.445

This operator just built a Chinese glyph integration layer across their LC flow engine, and their typing shows a rhythmic evening pattern of focused bursts followed by abandoned drafts and heavy restructuring edits, indicating they're iteratively refining complex system-wide changes through trial-and-error.

*   **Anticipate cross-module edits:** When they touch `self_fix seq13`, `dynamic_prompt seq17`, or `.operator_stats seq8`, proactively suggest related updates in the renamed `*_add_chinese_glyph.py` modules, as these are recurring pain points.
*   **Pre-empt restructuring fatigue:** During heavy-edit commits (evident from 56% deletion rates), offer concise, modular code blocks and explicitly ask, "Should this be a separate helper function?" to reduce rewrite churn.
*   **Bridge abandoned thoughts:** When they start a message but don't submit (abandoned state, ~37 WPM), infer intent from the partial input and provide a compact, actionable next step to recapture momentum.
*   **Leverage low miss-rate confidence:** With a 0.005 miss-rate, provide direct, prescriptive code; avoid exploratory options unless their typing shows hesitation (<0.5 hesitation score).
*   **Focus on integration points:** Since they renamed 13 files for glyph support, prioritize suggestions that connect these new modules to the existing flow engine context and registry systems.

They are most likely building toward a fully localized Chinese-language interface or content pipeline, requiring consistent glyph handling across all logging, task writing, and observation subsystems.

- `py -m pigeon_compiler.runners.run_clean_split_seq010*` — compile one file
- `py -m pigeon_compiler.runners.run_batch_compile_seq015*` — compile entire codebase
- `py -m pigeon_compiler.runners.run_heap_seq010*` — self-heal pipeline
- `py -m pigeon_compiler.git_plugin` — post-commit hook

## Registry & State Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pigeon_registry.json` | tracks every module: seq, ver, date, desc, intent, token history |
| `operator_profile.md` | living operator cognitive profile (auto-updated every 8 messages) |
| `MASTER_MANIFEST.md` | auto-generated project map (rebuilt on every commit) |
| `**/MANIFEST.md` | per-folder manifest, auto-rebuilt |
| `logs/pigeon_sessions/{name}.jsonl` | mutation audit trail per module |
| `test_logs/`, `demo_logs/`, `stress_logs/` | telemetry session data |

---

## Tests

```bash
py test_all.py   # 4 tests, all must pass, zero deps beyond stdlib
```

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| TEST 1 | TelemetryLogger — v2 schema, 3 turns, submit + discard |
| TEST 2 | Context Budget Scorer — hard cap, budget, coupling |
| TEST 3 | DriftWatcher — baseline + versioned filename drift |
| TEST 4 | Resistance Bridge — telemetry → compiler signal |

**Always run tests after edits.** If a test imports a file by full name, it will break after a pigeon rename — use glob/search patterns in tests.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Never hardcode full pigeon filenames** — they mutate on every commit. Use `file_search("module_name_seq*")`.
- **`py` not `python`** — this is Windows, use `py` launcher.
- **UTF-8 encoding** — always `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"` in PowerShell terminal.
- **Imports follow the pigeon name** — when a file is renamed, all `import` / `from` statements across the codebase are auto-rewritten by `rewrite_all_imports()`.
- **Don't delete monolith originals yet** — `src/operator_stats_seq008*`, `src/cognitive/unsaid_seq002*`, `src/cognitive/drift_seq003*` are still imported in some places. Verify before removing.
- **`streaming_layer_seq007*` is intentionally left as a 1150-line test harness** — drift_watcher tests flag it as OVER_HARD_CAP on purpose.
- **DeepSeek timeout** — phase 2 LLM calls can timeout; retry with a fresh call, don't loop.
