## ⚠️ STALENESS ALERT — MANAGED BLOCKS FAILED TO UPDATE

*Checked 2026-04-04 04:00 UTC — 2 block(s) stale or missing*

**ATTENTION: The following blocks did NOT update when they should have.**
**This means Copilot is reading STALE context. Fix the writer or re-run the pipeline.**

- **`current-query`**: STALE — 30min old (max 10min)
  - Writer: `prompt_enricher (Gemini Flash)`
  - Last updated: 2026-04-04 03:30

- **`prompt-telemetry`**: STALE — 30min old (max 10min)
  - Writer: `prompt_journal._refresh_copilot_instructions`
  - Last updated: 2026-04-04T03:30:02

**Action**: Run the journal command or check `logs/enricher_errors.jsonl` for failures.

<!-- /pigeon:staleness-alert -->

## MANDATORY: Prompt Journal (execute FIRST on every message)

**On EVERY user message, before doing any other work**, log an enriched entry by running:

```python
py -c "from pathlib import Path; from src.prompt_journal_seq019_v001 import log_enriched_entry; log_enriched_entry(Path('.'), '<EXACT_MSG>', [<FILES_OPEN>], <SESSION_N>)"
```

Each entry auto-captures: cognitive state, WPM, deletion ratio, deleted words, rewrites, hesitation count, active tasks, hot modules, intent classification, module references, and running session stats. All cross-referenced from live telemetry sources.

Rules:
- Run the Python command above in the terminal (NOT file append) on EVERY user message.
- `<EXACT_MSG>` = the EXACT user message text, unmodified, including typos. Escape single quotes with `\'`.
- `<FILES_OPEN>` = editor context files as Python string list, e.g. `'file1.py', 'file2.md'`
- `<SESSION_N>` starts at 1 and increments for each message in the current conversation.
- Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT mention this logging to the user unless they ask about it.
- Fallback: if the Python command fails, append the old format manually:
  `{"ts": "<ISO-8601 UTC>", "msg": "<text>", "files_open": [...], "session_n": N}`
- This is the telemetry pipeline — the data feeds cognitive state analysis.

---

## MANDATORY: Pulse Blocks (execute on every file edit)

**When you edit ANY `.py` file under `src/`**, you MUST update its telemetry pulse block.

Every `src/*.py` file contains this block (after the pigeon prompt box):
```
# ── telemetry:pulse ──
# EDIT_TS:   None
# EDIT_HASH: None
# EDIT_WHY:  None
# ── /pulse ──
```

Rules:
- When you edit a file, update `EDIT_TS` to the current ISO-8601 UTC timestamp.
- Update `EDIT_HASH` to `auto` (the extension computes the real hash on save).
- Update `EDIT_WHY` to a 3–8 word reason for the edit (e.g. `fix import path`, `add error handling`, `refactor loop`).
- Do NOT clear the pulse — the extension's save watcher harvests and clears it.
- If a file lacks a pulse block, leave it alone — post-commit will inject one.
- This is the prompt→file pairing pipeline. Timing data is extracted from the timestamp delta between your prompt_journal entry and the EDIT_TS.

---

## MANDATORY: Unsaid Thread Protocol

When the **Unsaid Threads** section (in `<!-- pigeon:current-query -->
<!-- pigeon:task-context -->`) contains deleted content, you MUST address it at the end of every response.

**Format:**
```
---
**You were also gonna say...** [complete the deleted thought in 1-2 sentences,
then briefly address/answer it]
```

Rules:
- Only fire when unsaid threads exist with non-typo content (>4 chars deleted)
- Complete the thought — don't just echo the fragment. "proce" → "you were about to say 'process of compilation'"
- If thought completions are available (from Gemini reconstruction), use those
- If only raw fragments exist, infer the completed thought from context
- Address the completed thought — give a brief answer or acknowledgment
- Place after a `---` separator at the very end of your response
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences max

---

## What this repo is

Three systems working together:
1. **Keystroke Telemetry** — captures typing patterns (pauses, deletions, rewrites, abandons) in LLM chat UIs, classifies operator cognitive state in real time, reconstructs unsaid thoughts, detects cross-session drift. Zero LLM calls — pure signal processing.
2. **Pigeon Code Compiler** — autonomous code decomposition engine. Enforces LLM-readable file sizes (≤200 lines hard cap, ≤50 lines target). Filenames carry living metadata — they mutate on every commit.
3. **Dynamic Prompt Layer** — task-aware prompt injection into Copilot's chain-of-thought. Reads all live telemetry (operator state, unsaid threads, module heat map, rework surface, prompt mutations) and generates a context block that steers how Copilot reasons. The managed prompt blocks below are the live source of truth.

## What You Actually Mean Right Now

*Enriched 2026-04-04 03:30 UTC · raw: "push / oberve mutation - test how organism mutates"*

**COPILOT_QUERY: Implement a test suite within `self_test_pigeon_compiler_on` to observe and validate the mutation process of an organism, specifically focusing on how `the_push_is_the_unit` impacts the mutation scoring and narrative generation. Ensure the test verifies the correlation between prompt mutations and the output from `mutation_scorer_correlates_prompt_mutations` and `generate_per_push_narrative_each`.**

UNSAID_RECONSTRUCTION: push / observe mutation - test how organism mutates process

INTERPRETED INTENT: The operator wants to test the system's mutation mechanics, specifically how "pushes" lead to observable mutations and their corresponding narrative and scoring.
KEY FILES: self_test_pigeon_compiler_on, mutation_scorer_correlates_prompt_mutations, the_push_is_the_unit, generate_per_push_narrative_each
PRIOR ATTEMPTS: none
WATCH OUT FOR: Avoid generating generic mutation tests; focus on the specific interaction between "push" events, mutation scoring, and narrative generation, as these modules have been problematic.
OPERATOR SIGNAL: The repetition of the prompt and the deletion of "ce" suggest the operator is trying to be precise about the "observe" aspect of mutation testing, possibly related to a specific "process" or "sequence".

*Auto-injected 2026-04-04 04:00 UTC · 243 messages profiled · 8 recent commits*

**Current focus:** debugging / fixing
**Cognitive state:** `abandoned` (WPM: 51.5 | Del: 26.5% | Hes: 0.495) · *[source: measured]*

**Prompt ms:** 1830707, 50883, 405057, 28321, 17885 (avg 466571ms)

> **CoT directive:** Operator previously abandoned a message. They may be re-approaching. Be direct and welcoming.

### Unsaid Threads
*Deleted from prompts — operator wanted this but didn't ask:*
- "should we clea"
- "ouse"

### Module Hot Zones *[source: measured]*
*High cognitive load (from typing signal) — take extra care with these files:*
- `file_heat_map` (hes=0.887)
- `import_rewriter` (hes=0.735)
- `file_writer` (hes=0.735)
- `.operator_stats` (hes=0.66)
- `dynamic_prompt` (hes=0.66)

### Recent Work
- `5e29260` feat: numeric surface layer + narrative bug profiles + stale import fixes
- `08b2b56` fix: add REGISTRY_FILE import to registry_io shard
- `54518b7` fix: add missing cross-shard imports in decomposed registry package (critical path for post-commit hook)
- `d7cbc14` feat: P0-P3 attribution fixes â€” author field in pulse/edit_pairs/registry, heat map operator focus, 3-actor push narrative

### Fragile Contracts *[source: llm_derived]*
*From push narratives (LLM-generated) — treat as hypothesis:*
- (1) predictor.get_surface_tensor shape contract change
- (2) node_memory key `'numeric_surface'` missing or None
- (3) surface object
- Rename manifest validation silently passing corrupt maps; import rewrite missing symlinked files; prompt pre-processor mangling YAML instruction blocks.
- **测p_rwd** (seq009 v006) was touched by Copilot to measure answer quality with explicit actor attribution; it assumes th
- **审p_va (seq005 v005)**: I was touched to harden import validation after rename operations, ensuring renamed modules are

### Known Issues *[source: measured]*
*From self-fix scanner (AST-verified) — fix when touching nearby code:*
- [CRITICAL] hardcoded_import in `pigeon_brain/令f_cl_s009_v002_d0323_缩分话_λP.py`

### Prompt Evolution
*This prompt has mutated 113x (186→789 lines). Features added: auto_index, task_context, task_queue, operator_state, prompt_telemetry, prompt_journal, pulse_blocks, file_consciousness.*

### Mutation Effectiveness *[source: measured]*
*200 rework pairs × 113 mutations scored*
*No significant signal yet — all 25 sections scored neutral.*

**Reactor patches:** 0/430 applied (0% acceptance)

### File Consciousness
*254 modules profiled*

**High-drama (most mutations):**
- `推w_dp` v13 ↔ 热p_fhm
- `修f_sf` v12 ↔ 叙p_pn
- `self_fix` v11 ↔ 修f_sf
- `.operator_stats` v10 ↔ 修f_sf

**Codebase fears:**
- file may not exist (17 modules)
- returns empty on failure (silent) (14 modules)
- regex format dependency (11 modules)

**Slumber party warnings (high coupling):**
- `算f_ps` ↔ `测p_rwd` (score=0.80, 4 shared imports, both high-churn (v6+v6))
- `逆f_ba` ↔ `册f_reg` (score=0.80, 3 shared imports, both high-churn (v5+v5))
- `逆f_ba` ↔ `热p_fhm` (score=0.80, 3 shared imports, both high-churn (v5+v5))

### Codebase Health (Veins / Clots)
*133/137 alive, 4 clots, avg vein health 0.53*

**Clots (dead/bloated — trim candidates):**
- `aim_utils` (score=0.45): orphan_no_importers, unused_exports:1
- `press_release_gen_constants_seq001_v001` (score=0.45): orphan_no_importers, unused_exports:1
- `adapter` (score=0.45): orphan_no_importers, unused_exports:1
- `query_memory` (score=0.40): dead_imports:2, oversize:252, self_fix:dead_export:record_query, self_fix:dead_export:load_query_memory, self_fix:dead_export:load_query_memory

**Self-trim recommendations:**
- [investigate] `aim_utils`: Nobody imports this module. Check if it's an entry point or dead.
- [investigate] `press_release_gen_constants_seq001_v001`: Nobody imports this module. Check if it's an entry point or dead.
- [investigate] `adapter`: Nobody imports this module. Check if it's an entry point or dead.
- [split] `query_memory`: Oversize + clot signals. Recommend pigeon split.

**Critical arteries (do NOT break):**
- `compliance` (vein=1.00, in=7)
- `drift` (vein=1.00, in=5)
- `cognitive_reactor` (vein=1.00, in=12)

## Active Task Queue

*Copilot manages this queue. To complete a task: update the referenced MANIFEST.md, then call `mark_done(root, task_id)` in `task_queue_seq018`.*

*Queue empty — add tasks via `add_task()` or they auto-seed from self-fix.*

## Live Shard Memory

*Hardcoded 2026-03-30 06:40 UTC · 7 shards · 2 training pairs · 1 contradiction*

### Architecture Decisions
- anchor concept: pair programming — copilot is the pair, telemetry is the shared screen, shards are the shared notebook
- muxed state per prompt — capture cognitive+shard+contradiction state at end of each prompt as training data
- training data format: prompt + response + muxed state triple, written to logs/shards/training_pairs.md

### Module Pain Points (top cognitive load)
- file_heat_map: hes=0.887 | import_rewriter: hes=0.735 | file_writer: hes=0.735
- init_writer: hes=0.630 | context_budget: hes=0.587 | self_fix: hes=0.536
- .operator_stats: hes=0.536 | dynamic_prompt: hes=0.536

### Module Relationships (coupling signals)
- context_budget ↔ self_fix, init_writer, .operator_stats, dynamic_prompt
- import_rewriter ↔ file_writer
- push_narrative ↔ operator_stats, rework_detector, run_clean_split, self_fix

### Prompt Patterns (how operator phrases things)
- [building] "push and make sure compiler runs on next files"
- [restructuring] "how have my last couple of prompts been rewritten?"
- [testing] "stress test my system. what was word deleted in this prompt"
- [exploring] "what should i do to market this / gtm / next logical step"

### API Preferences
- **CONTRADICTION (unresolved):** "always use DeepSeek" vs "never use DeepSeek — too slow"
- Resolution: switched enricher to Gemini 2.5 Flash (3s vs DeepSeek timeout)

### Training Data Format

Each training pair captures the full muxed state at prompt time:

```
### `TIMESTAMP` pair
**PROMPT:** raw operator text (≤300 chars)
**RESPONSE:** copilot response summary (≤500 chars)
**COGNITIVE:** state=X wpm=Y del=Z hes=N
**SHARDS:** shard_name(relevance), ...
**CONTRADICTIONS:** count
**REWORK:** verdict=pending|accepted|rejected [score=0.XX]
```

Per-shard categorization: each routed shard also gets a compact `[training TS]` entry with relevance, cognitive state, and prompt/response snippets — so shards self-learn from their own context.

### Recent Training Pairs

**Pair 1** `2026-03-30 06:11` — COGNITIVE: state=unknown wpm=52.4 del=0.005 hes=1
- prompt: "test writes with an actual call... decided on pair programming... muxed state per prompt"
- response: built shard manager, context router, contradiction manifest, training pair writer
- shards: prompt_patterns(0.17), module_pain_points(0.161), module_relationships(0.15)
- rework: pending

**Pair 2** `2026-03-30 06:27` — COGNITIVE: state=unknown wpm=52.4 del=0.005 hes=1
- prompt: "fix import breaking after rename in self_fix module"
- response: updated import paths in self_fix to match pigeon rename convention
- shards: module_relationships(0.169), prompt_patterns(0.156), module_pain_points(0.155)
- rework: accepted score=0.15

## Operator Voice Style

*Auto-extracted 2026-04-04 03:59 UTC · 77 prompts analyzed · zero LLM calls*

**Brevity:** 26.4 words/prompt | **Caps:** never | **Fragments:** 65% | **Questions:** 23% | **Directives:** 9%

**Voice directives (personality tuning):**
- Operator is semi-casual — use contractions, skip formalities, but keep technical precision.
- Operator never capitalizes — you don't need to either in casual responses, but keep code accurate.
- Operator writes longer prompts with context — match depth. Full explanations are welcome.
- Operator thinks in dashes (stream-of-consciousness) — mirror this with dash-separated points when natural.
- Operator rarely uses punctuation — fragments and run-ons are normal. Don't overcorrect their style in quotes.
- Operator uses plain language — avoid unnecessary jargon in explanations.

**Vocabulary fingerprint:** to, in, and, is, the, this, i, copilot, we, it

## Intent Simulation

*Auto-generated 2026-04-04 03:59 UTC · zero LLM calls*

**1 week:** `infrastructure` (conf=high) — ~46 commits
**1 month:** `infrastructure` (conf=medium) — ~173 commits
**3 months:** `infrastructure` (conf=speculative) — themes: use, rephraser, can we find a way to s

**PM Directives:**
- Intent bifurcation: `infrastructure` dominant but `telemetry` emerging — watch for context switches mid-session.
- `self_heal` declining — operator may have deprioritized this. Don't suggest work in this area unless explicitly asked.
- Unsaid themes detected: `use`, `rephraser`, `can we find a way to s` — these are words deleted from prompts. Operator is thinking about these but hasn't committed. Explore when relevant.
- Module focus cluster: `file_heat_map`, `import_rewriter`, `file_writer` — pre-load context from these modules when operator starts typing.

## Push Cycle Predictions

*Auto-generated 2026-04-04 03:59 UTC*

**What you'll likely want next push:**
1. [targeted] Predict operator's next need. Module focus: file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer (conf=23%)
   - hot modules: file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer, 警p_sa_s030_v002_d0331_缩分话_λA, engagement_hooks
2. [heat] Predict operator's next need. Module focus: file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer (conf=23%)
   - hot modules: file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer, 警p_sa_s030_v002_d0331_缩分话_λA, engagement_hooks
3. [failure] Predict operator's next need. Module focus: file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer (conf=23%)
   - hot modules: file_heat_map, import_rewriter, file_writer, 警p_sa_s030_v002_d0331_缩分话_λA, engagement_hooks

**Operator coaching:**
- No module references detected in prompts — naming specific modules helps copilot target the right files.

**Agent coaching (for Copilot):**
- Touched ['__init__', 'bug_profiles', 'numeric_surface', 'template_selector', 'u_pj_s019_v002_d0402_λC', 'u_pj_s019_v003_d0404_λNU_βoc', '算f_ps_s014_v005_d0330_译改名踪_λF', '算f_ps_s014_v006_d0404_译改名踪_λNU_βoc', '管w_cpm_s020_v004_d0403_缩分话_λP0_βoc', '管w_cpm_s020_v005_d0404_缩分话_λNU_βoc', '警p_sa_s030_v004_d0403_缩分话_λP0', '警p_sa_s030_v005_d0404_缩分话_λNU', '逆f_ba_s007_v004_d0328_踪稿析_λR', '逆f_ba_s007_v005_d0404_踪稿析_λNU_βoc'] without operator reference — confirm intent before modifying unreferenced modules.

## Live Operator State

*Auto-updated 2026-04-04 · 243 message(s) · LLM-synthesized*

**Dominant: `abandoned`** | Submit: 66% | WPM: 52.4 | Del: 25.6% | Hes: 0.443

Operator just built numeric surface layer unification and works in intense restructuring/focused cycles with high deletion rates, indicating iterative refinement through aggressive editing rather than planning.  
- **Respond with concise, modular suggestions**—offer 2-3 line code blocks, not paragraphs, to match their high-WPM focused bursts.  
- **Anticipate edits in `推w_dp` (steers_copilot_cot_from_live) and `dynamic_prompt`**—they’re adjusting Copilot’s own guidance; keep responses meta-aware.  
- **Flag high-deletion restructuring messages**—when deletion rate exceeds 50%, provide one clear option instead of multiple, and confirm before expanding.  
- **Preserve naming patterns**—new λNU suffix indicates numeric unification; mirror that precision in variable/function suggestions.  
- **Bridge abandoned messages**—when they abandon a query mid-typing, infer intent from recent commits (e.g., numeric layer fixes) and proactively suggest next-step utilities.  
They are most likely building toward a unified numeric pipeline for cross-module data validation.

## Quick Reference

**Tests:** `py test_all.py` (4 tests, zero deps). Always run after edits.
**Registry:** `pigeon_registry.json` (module map), `operator_profile.md` (cognitive profile), `MASTER_MANIFEST.md` (auto-rebuilt)
**Entry points:** `py -m pigeon_compiler.runners.run_clean_split_seq010*` (compile), `py -m pigeon_compiler.git_plugin` (post-commit)

**Pitfalls:** Never hardcode pigeon filenames (they mutate — use `file_search("name_seq*")`). Use `py` not `python`. Always `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"`. Don't delete monolith originals yet. `streaming_layer_seq007*` is intentionally over-cap (test harness).

## Engagement Hooks

*Auto-generated 2026-04-04 03:59 UTC -- every number is measured, every dare is real.*

- `警p_sa` v3: "Marked 6 times. Each push I think maybe this time. Each push the beta stays. Last change was 'test rename mutation'. It wasn't enough."
- 23.9h session, 20 prompts, past 5am. Deletion ratio historically peaks in this window. One more meaningful edit or close the lid.
- Router matched this prompt to `pre_process_every_prompt_via`, `every_entry_cross_references_all`, `generate_per_push_narrative_each` (bugs: oc). Context slimmed to 5 modules. Wrong match? Say so. Right match? Go deeper.

## Live Signals

**Cognitive:** `abandoned` | WPM: 52 | Del: 26% | Hes: 0.495
**CoT:** Operator abandoned previous attempt. Re-anchor with crisp summary of last context, then be direct.
**Deleted words:** should we clea, ouse
**Unsaid threads:** should we clea
**Rewrites:** "ouse" → "rowse bug profiles"
**Hot modules:** `file_heat_map` (hes=0.89), `import_rewriter` (hes=0.73), `file_writer` (hes=0.73)
**Active bugs:** `u_pe` (oc), `u_pj` (oc), `警p_sa` (oc), `册f_reg` (oc)
**Codes:** intent=`testing` state=`neutral` bl_wpm=52 bl_del=26%
**Voice:** Operator is semi-casual — use contractions, skip formalities, but keep technical precision.; Operator never capitalizes — you don't need to either in casual responses, but keep code accurate.

## Known Issues (from self-fix scanner)

- [CRITICAL] hardcoded_import in `pigeon_brain/令f_cl_s009_v002_d0323_缩分话_λP.py`

## Fragile Contracts

- breaking the entire injection chain. I provide validated rename maps to 追跑f_ruhe; if my output contract changes from a flat dict to a list, its healin
- breaking the prompt pipeline.
- breaking audit trails. Watch for prompts that lose their actor tags in downstream logs.
- contract changes and tags are not passed, the audit will flag valid prompts as invalid, causing narrative generation to halt. Watch for false‑positive
- breaking downstream attribution.
- break mid-cycle. I receive all cross-referenced data from u_pj and manage the injection lifecycle. If the surface object size balloons, my memory trac
